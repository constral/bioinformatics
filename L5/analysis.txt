points on the plot differ mainly because of three factors:
1) repeat content and motif redundancy: genomes that have many repeated
   short motifs create ambiguous overlaps among reads and require more
   pairwise checks during greedy assembly. such genomes tend to appear
   as points with larger assembly times and more fragmented outputs.
2) genome length and effective coverage: longer genomes sampled with
   the same fixed number of reads have lower effective coverage. lower
   coverage reduces the number of long overlaps found and can both
   reduce and unpredictably increase assembly time depending on how many
   candidate overlaps must be scanned. these effects change point
   positions in a non-linear way.
3) chance and read distribution: sampling randomness changes which
   overlaps exist and how easy they are to find. even with identical
   gc%, two genomes with different internal structure can have quite
   different assembly times. thus gc% alone is not a reliable predictor
   of assembly cost; internal sequence structure and coverage matter
   more.

the scatterplot places assembly time on the vertical axis and gc% on
the horizontal axis. points with high assembly time are typically those
whose genomes produced many ambiguous overlaps or required more
pairwise comparisons during greedy merging. differences in gc% may
correspond to differences in base composition but do not alone
explain the assembly cost differences observed.
